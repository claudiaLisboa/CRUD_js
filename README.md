# CRUD_js

### `Created by Claudia Lisboa - For studying purpose` 

- In this project I'll build a simple CRUD example using Vanilla Javascript. 
- However, this CRUD will not use any database, just an HTML table that will be manipulated by the implemented Javascript. 
- This was done this way because there is no way to natively connect Javascript to a database. 
- Although I do not use databases, this CRUD offers the opportunity to “play” a little with Vanilla Javascript and create a functional interface using only simple resources.
